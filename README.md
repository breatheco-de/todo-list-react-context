## üå±  How to start this project

Do not clone this repository! You will be using a different template.

We recommend opening the `react.js boilerplate`, using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can [clone the GitHub repository](https://4geeks.com/how-to/github-clone-repository) on your local computer using the `git clone` command.

This is the repository you need to open or clone:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello-webapp
```

üîé Important: Remember to create a new repository, update the remote URL (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and upload the code to your new repository using `add`, `commit` and `push`.

## üìù Instructions:

- Your app needs to look [like this](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-todo-list/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true).

- The tasks are added when the user presses enter on the keyboard or you can have your own button.

- The delete icon shows only when the task is hovered.

- The user can add as many tasks as it wants.

- When there are no tasks the list should display "No tasks, add a task"

- There is no way to update a task, the user will have to delete and create it again.

## üí° Tips to finish this project:

Do not go straight to the code, think first and have a viable strategy.

- What components will you create? Draw the project on a white paper and identify components.

- Where are the tasks going to be stored in your component?

- Read about [controlled components inputs in react.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6YxkyR_T8c), you will need to understand the concept.
